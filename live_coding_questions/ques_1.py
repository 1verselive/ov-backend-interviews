"""
Write 3 classes - Derived class, base_1 class, and base_2 class. 
The derived class should inherit base_1 and base_2 classes.
Any derived class object created should be initiated with 2 variables - a,b.
Any base_1 class object created should be initiated with variable a and base_2 class object should be initiated with variable b.
On creating a base_1 class object, a new variable c should be attributed to the object with the value 5*a.
On creating a base_2 class object, a new variable d should be attributed to the object with the value 10*b.
Write a python program to create a derived class object with a=2,b=3 and print the 2 new variables (c,d) created.
